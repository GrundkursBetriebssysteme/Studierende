Linux / Unix ps command
About ps
Reports the process status.
Syntax
ps [-a] [-A] [-c] [-d] [-e] [-f] [-j] [-l] [-L] [-P] [-y] [ -g grplist ] [ -n namelist ] [-o format ] [ -p proclist ] [ -s sidlist ] [ -t term] [ -u uidlist ] [ -U uidlist ] [ -G gidlist ]
-a	List information about all processes most frequently requested: all those except process group leaders and processes not associated with a terminal.
-A	List information for all processes. Identical to -e, below.
-c	Print information in a format that reflects scheduler properties as described in priocntl.
The -c option affects the output of the -f and -l options, as described below.
-d	List information about all processes except session leaders.
-e	List information about every process now running.
-f	Generate a full listing.
-j	Print session ID and process group ID.
-l	Generate a long listing.
-L	Print information about each light weight process (lwp) in each selected process.
-P	Print the number of the processor to which the process or lwp is bound, if any, under an additional column header, PSR.
-y	Under a long listing (-l), omit the obsolete F and ADDR columns and include an RSS column to report the resident set size of the process. Under the -y option, both RSS and SZ will be reported in units of kilobytes instead of pages.
-g grplist	List only process data whose group leader's ID number(s) appears in grplist. (A group leader is a process whose process ID number is identical to its process group ID number.)
-n namelist	Specify the name of an alternative system namelist file in place of the default. This option is accepted for compatibility, but is ignored.
-o format	Print information according to the format specification given in format. This is fully described in DISPLAY FORMATS. Multiple -o options can be specified; the format specification will be interpreted as the space-character-separated concatenation of all the format option-arguments.
-p proclist	List only process data whose process ID numbers are given in proclist.
-s sidlist	List information on all session leaders whose IDs appear in sidlist.
-t term	List only process data associated with term. Terminal identifiers are specified as a device file name, and an identifier. For example, term/a, or pts/0.
-u uidlist	List only process data whose effective user ID number or login name is given in uidlist. In the listing, the numerical user ID will be printed unless you give the -f option, which prints the login name.
-U uidlist	List information for processes whose real user ID numbers or login names are given in uidlist. The uidlist must be a single argument in the form of a blank- or comma-separated list.
-G gidlist	List information for processes whose real group ID numbers are given in gidlist. The gidlist must be a single argument in the form of a blank- or comma-separated list.
Examples
ps
Typing ps alone would list the current running processes. Below is an example of the output that would be generated by the ps command.
PID   TTY   TIME   CMD
6874  pts/9   0:00     ksh
6877  pts/9   0:01     csh
418    pts/9   0:00     csh
ps -ef
Display full information about each of the processes currently running.
